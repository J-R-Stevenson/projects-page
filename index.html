<p> I am using this page to provide a way to access some of my projects from one place. </em> 

<h2> Finished Projects </h2>


<ol> 
	<li> <a href="https://tree-methods-for-finance.streamlit.app/"> Binomial tree visualizer and calculator </a> </li>
		<ul>
			<li> I use Python to create a web app consisting of two parts. The first is a binomial tree calculator that prices a variety of
financial options according to user-selected parameters. The second is an essay on the theory of binomial trees. </li>
		</ul>
	<li> <a href="Mortgage30.html"> ARIMA modeling of 30 year mortgage rate </a> </li>
		<ul>
			<li> Here is the start of my attempt to explore a single variable, the 30 year mortgage rate, through time series analysis. I walk through the steps
of constructing an ARIMA model and then use it to forecast the rate in the near future. </li>
		</ul>
	
</ol>


<h2> Unfinished Projects </h2>

<ol>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/J-R-Stevenson/Explorations-in-Monte-Carlo-Pricing/blob/main/Monte%20Carlo%20Pricing.ipynb"> Monte Carlo option pricing </a> </li>
		<ul>
			<li> A while back I got really interested in Monte Carlo methods. I had this idea to create a Jupyter notebook similar to the binomial tree visualizer and
calculator in order to get my head around them. I never finished it, but I did manage to get quite a bit done with an implementation of the "Longstaff-Schwartz" method of 
pricing an American option so I am leaving a link here. </li>
		</ul>
</ol>
