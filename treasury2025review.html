<p>
The market for U.S. Treasury securities has been described as the "deepest and most liquid" financial market in the world. It serves as the bedrock of the U.S. and global
financial systems. However, the Treasury market has faced a number of growing pressures since the global financial crisis as a result of regulatory changes, sustained 
federal deficits, Federal Reserve policies, and rising geopolitical tensions. In this post, I look at the data with a particular focus 
on reviewing changes in these trends in 2025. 
</p>

<h2> Headline Figures on the National Debt </h2>


<p> As of the latest Monthly Statement of the Public Debt from the Treasury Department (November 30, 2025), the total national debt, including both debt held by 
the public and intragovernmental debt, stands at $38 trillion. This is 3-4 times greater than it was prior to the global financial crisis (GFC hereafter). </p>

<img src=images/TotalNationalDebtOutstanding.png alt="Chart" width="700" height="400"> 

<p> We might also consider the debt-to-GDP ratio, which also points to historically elevated debt levels. </p>

<img src=images/DebtGDPHistorical.png alt="Chart" width="700" height="400"> 

<p> We might also consider monthly issuance of marketable debt, now 4-5 times higher than pre-GFC. This is in part a result of increased
deficits necessitating more debt issuance and in part a result of the changing structure of the national debt away from nonmarketable
debt (more on this later). </p>

<img src=images/MonthlyIssuanceMarketable.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 

<p> The current rise in the national debt began with the resumption of federal deficits in 2002 after a brief period of surpluses (1998-2001).
But it was not until the global financial crisis that it began to balloon. In 2009, the deficit-to-GDP ratio (-9.75%) reached its highest
levels since WWII (not pictured below). The COVID-19 pandemic aggravated the debt problem. In 2020, the deficit-to-GDP ratio was -14.65%. </p>

<img src=images/DeficittoGDP.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 




<p> Public debts have a tendency to beget more debt. A government borrows to make up for the gap between revenue and spending. More
borrowing means larger interest payments to be made on the public debt. If the original gap between revenue and spending is not addressed 
(perhaps because of external shocks or internal gridlock), then the gap is widened by the increased interest payments, necessitating
further borrowing. The cycle continues until it is intentionally reversed. Consider the rise of net interest payments, increasing as a share
of the debt and as share of federal spending. Net interest-to-GDP doubled from 1.49% in 2022 to 3.01% in 2024. Net interest payments as a percentage of
federal outlays have increased from 5.2% in 2021 to a twenty five year high of 13.0% in 2024. </p>

<h2> Yields </h2>

<p> Rising debt burdens are aggravated by high interest rates. High debt loads in themselves may contribute to increased interest rates as investors price in risk associated
with high debt levels. The U.S. is not alone in facing the problem of high rates and high debt levels, a difficult combination. A sample of three yields show that rates were
relatively high historically for 2025, a fact which may have contributed to rate cut decisions by the Fed this year. Lower rates will depend on the Fed's ability to effectively
conduct monetary policy (more on that later). </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/DailyYields9025.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Looking across a range of maturities, Treasuries were mostly within 4-5% for par yields. The yield curve was upward sloping this year (see below for the return of a positive term
premium).  </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/yields20251.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> As was known at the time, April saw sharp rises in yields as markets panicked in response to the administration's announcements across-the-board tariffs. The 
short- and medium-term end of the  Treasury market seems to have recovered from these shocks, but longer-term yields have had more difficulty. After a period of 
relative normalization, long-term yields  actually rose, doing so in spite of Fed rate cuts this year. The 30-year yield shot up from 4.52% to as high as 4.91% in 
April and now sits around 4.8%. Not pictured is the 20-year yield, which rose from 4.56% to 4.9% in April and is now around 4.76%. </p>


<figure>
	<img src=images/yields20252.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> We see significant monthly volatility in April as expected. We also note elevated volatility in February and May. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/MonthlyYieldVolatility.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>


<h2> Auctions </h2>

<p> New issues of Treasury securities are sold at auctions. Each auction consists of the sale of a specific issue with a
certain maturity (e.g. 13 weeks, 10 years) and amount (e.g. $50 billion). The yield (and thus the price) are determined 
by the auction according to the competitive bids placed. By looking at auction data, we can learn about the government's
ability to issue new debt and the market's ability to absorb it. </p>

<p> Consider first the bid-to-cover ratio, the ratio of the aggregate amount bidded (or requested) by bidders to the amount sold
at the auction. A low bid-to-cover ratio indicates low liquidity as the market is unwilling or unable to take on new issues of Treasuries. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/bidtocoverratiosbonds.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src=images/bidtocoverratiosnotes.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Bid-to-cover ratios have largely maintained consistent levels, around 2.5, for the past decade. The events of April 2025 do not
seem to have produced any noticable historical outliers at auctions. </p>

<p> Buyers at Treasury auction can be divided into three groups: primary dealers, direct bidders, and indirect bidders. Primary dealers are a group of bank and
non-bank Treasury dealers that have a special working relationship with the Fed. The New York Fed describe them as its "trading counterparties...in its implementation
of monetary policy." The New York Fed further delineates some of their key responsibilities: participating in the Fed's open market operations, bidding in all 
Treasury auctions at "reasonable competitive prices," and making markets in Treasuries. </p>

<p> All other bidders at auction are classified as either direct or indirect
bidders, representing a diverse group of institutions. Direct bidders are investors (other than primary dealers) who place bids to obtain Treasuries for their
own account. Indirect bidders are investors who place bids through an intermediary. An indirect bid can be submitted through a primary dealer, but auction results
distinguish between primary dealers bidding for their own accounts  and a primary dealer bidding on behalf of another investors. </p>

<p> An auction is composed of competitive and noncompetitive bids. A noncompetitive bid is the amount of an issue that an investor is willing to purchase regardless of the outcome of the 
auction. They are filled out first. The noncompetitive bids specify both amounts and price. They are filled out depending on the size of the issue, an amount which is decided by the
Treasury beforehand. At auction, the Treasury first determines the amount of the issue remaining after all noncompetitive bids are filled. Then it starts from the highest bid and begins 
counting down to lower and lower bids until it reaches the price at which the entire issue would be filled. This price (or more properly, this yield) is the price which all bidders, 
noncompetitive and competitive, will pay regardless of their bid so long as they had bid at least that price for some quantity. Since it may be the case that the amount bid at the 
winning yield is too large to be filled by the issue, bidders at the "winning" yield may receive only a partial amount of their bid for that yield. </p>

<p>Historically primary dealers have been the key players and market makers in Treasuries for most of history post-WWII. Yet their declining importance since the GFC has been well 
documented, and we can see their share of market activity continue to decrease when looking at auction data. We start by looking at monthly share of awards (an award being the actual
sale of a Treasury to an investor at auction). 
</p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/AwardShareWithIssuanceHistorical.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> We see a gradual decline of primary dealer share of auction awards in the last 10-15 years. The gradual nature of the decline is important. It was not an immediate fall from 
relevance as a result of the GFC, from which the primary dealers initially recovered from according to the data. This recovery ends in 2012-13, the start of a decline from about 60% of 
total monthly issuance to 30% of total monthly issuance. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/GrossMonthlyAwards5Years.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> We see that this decline roughly coincides with a gradual (then sudden) increase of total monthly issuance, suggesting that increased supply has 
something to with the declining position of primary dealers. Let us look break down the data for bills, notes, and bonds separately. </p> 

<figure>
	<img src=images/AwardShareWithIssuanceBonds.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src=images/AwardShareWithIssuanceNotes.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> This breakdown shows just how spectular the displacement of primary dealers at auction has really become. Indirect bidders surpassed primary dealers in bonds 
and notes by 2014. Even direct bidders and SOMA roll-over purchases surpass current primary dealer shares of bills and bonds at auction, averaging around 10% of
total monthly issuance. Even if indirect bidders are using primary dealers as intermediaries, the fact still remains that primary dealers no longer play an important
role in absorbing normal Treasury issuance of notes and bonds. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/AwardShareWithIssuanceBills.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> The story is slightly different in bills, which on account of their short duration make up the majority of Treasury issuance. It took longer for indirect bidders 
to surpass primary dealers (around 2020-2021), which are still the second largest awardees at auction, absorbing around 30% of monthly issuance. Primary dealers thus 
still play a significant role in absorbing monthly issuance of bills, a role more important on account of Treasury's increased issuance of bills (see the section on maturity), 
but even here their role in absorbing issuance has been significantly reduced. </p>

<p> The divergence in auction allocations between bills and bonds/notes can also be seen in the spead between the
highest and lowest yield (for notes and bonds) or discount (for bills) offered at auctions. Spreads have increased
in variability to a noticable degree in the last decade for notes and bonds. Aside from a spike in 2023 (worthy of
investigation), such a shift is not yet noticable in bills. </p>

</figure>

<figure>
	<img src=images/auctionyieldspread.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Looking at gross monthly awards rather than share, we see further evidence that increased issuance is involved in the changing role of primary dealers.
Primary dealers are not necessarily purchasing less at auction, but the main driver, particularly in the last five years, has been increased issuance. Primary
dealer demand has not kept with issuance, but rather indirect bidders have stepped in to absorb increased supply. </p>

</figure>

<figure>
	<img src=images/GrossMonthlyAwardsHistoricalSOMA.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Who are the indirect bidders? The New York Fed publishes a list of primary dealers and defines some of their key responsibilities, but indirect bidders
are united only by two facts: (1) they are not primary dealers and (2) they place bids at auctions through an intermediary. Let us look at award share across
investor class in the hopes of clarifying this issue. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/QuarterlyAwardsICBonds.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

</figure>

<figure>
	<img src=images/QuarterlyAwardsICBills.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>	

<p> The above charts break down the average share of awards at auction by quarter by investor class. It plots allotments for four major classes, categorized by
the Treasury Department. Brokers and dealers include both primary and non-primary dealers, but comparing with our other data on auction shares we can say that
it largely tracks primary dealer share. The Treasury defines investment funds as including "mutual funds, money market funds, hedge funds, money managers, and
investment advisors." (SOMA is the System Open Market Account of the Federal Reserve, of which we will have more to say later). The data on investor class
aware share shows that primary dealers have been largely displaced at auctions by the relatively broad category of investment funds, who likely place most of their
bids through intermediaries with a sizable amount of bidding done directly. </p>

<p> This data leads to more questions. Which kind of funds are driving the rise in investment fund participation at auctions? One plausible theory is that it is largely
the result of hedge funds engaging in the cash-futures basis trade. As a result of post-GFC regulations, primary dealer balance sheets have become significantly constrained,
unable to easily expand to absorb Treasury supply. There is compelling evidence that the vacuum left by primary dealers is being filled by hedge funds. </p>

<p> The theory receives from 
strong support from confidential hedge fund reporting data on SEC Form PF, which is not publicly available, but it is worthwhile to summarize the main points of the theory. In the 
cash-futures basis trades, an investor goes long a Treasury security (the cash part) and simultaneously goes short a futures contract in that Treasury. The long leg of the trade is 
financed by repoing the Treasury (a repo, or repurchase agreement, consists of a holder of Treasury security lending that security to another investor in exchange for cash today, 
and at some time in the future the initial holder "repurchases" the Treasury at a higher price). The profit from the trade comes from the difference between the price of value of a 
Treasury purchased outright (in the so-called cash market) and the value of a Treasury futures contract. This difference is often only a handful of basis points (hence the name "basis 
trade"), so profitability requires hedge funds to take on significant amounts on leverage. <p>

<p> The profitability of the trade is said to have come from increasingly frequency disconnects between the price of Treasury securities and Treasury futures contracts. Treasury
futures contracts have been relatively overvalued compared to the underlying securities, particularly so since 2020. Asset managers (mutual funds, insurance
companies, pension funds, etc.) have increased long positions in Treasury futures contract recently as a way to easily achieve leverage and exposure to Treasury
securities without directly holding them. This has helped to fuel hedge fund net short positions in Treasury futures (and the two might also mutually reinforce
each other). See this chart from a Treasury report entitled "Discussion of Treasury Futures Positions Across Different Investor Types."

<figure>
	<img src=images/TBACNetFutures.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> This also helps explain the discrepancy between bills and notes and bonds. T-bill futures trade in much lower volumes than note and bond futures. But does this theory
help us understand the auction data? We do not see any significant decline in investment share of awards during April 2025 or March 2020, at least no decline consonant with
the view that hedge funds were unwinding the basis trade during both of these months due to market crises increasing volatility (thereby increasing margin requirements for
futures contracts). Further investigation is needed to clarify the nature of investment fund participation at auctions. </p>

<h2> Foreign ownership </h2>

<p> The question of who owns the growing supply of Treasuries has become increasingly important. Rising geopolitical tensions have led to
intensified concerns about the dollar's status as global reserve currency. We should look to the data to understand the actual behavior 
of foreign investors with regard to ownership of Treasuries, because the market for Treasuries is the bedrock of the global dollar system. </p>

<p> We will look at data from the Treasury International Capital system (TIC) on foreign holdings and transactions of Treasuries. We keep two things in mind. One 
is that the survey is really only reliable and consistent in its monthly data on transactions since 2023, so we only look at the last few years of monthly data. 
Second is that TIC attribution of holdings to a country are necessarily imperfect, as the Treasury has long admitted. One issue is that if an investor from
country A hold a Treasury security in a custodial account in country B, then TIC would attribute the ownership to country B. Another issue may arise when a
company from country A is legally incorporated in country B, then TIC would attribute ownership to country B. This second case results in such curiousities as
the Cayman Islands, a popular spot for U.S. hedge fund incorporation, being one of the largest holders of Treasuries on TIC data. There is also the issue that
Cayman Island holdings (as a proxy for hedge fund activity) is greatly underestimated by TIC due to the difficulty of tracking repoed Treasuries. But we are
interested here primarily in the behavior of investors based outside the U.S., so TIC underestimation of Cayman Island holdings will not be an issue here. </p>

<p> With all that in mind, let us begin by comparing the ten largest holders in January 2025 to October 2025. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/10LargestHoldingsJan25.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src=images/10LargestHoldingsOct25.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Note that foreign holdings increased both absolutely (~$600 billion) and as a percentage of total public debt (~0.5%). Just about
all major holders increased their aggregate holdings. The notable exception is China, which actually decreased its holdings by about
$100 billion this year (more on this later). In the midst of chilly relations between Washington and Ottawa over tariffs, Canadian
holdings of Treasuries increased. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/ForeignHoldingsofTreasuries.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> TIC data shows substantial negative net sales of Treasuries in April 2025. Negative net sales meaning
foreign investors sold more than they bought from domestic holders. Yet net foreign sales were positive in later
months. The effects of April 2025 on Treasury securities have not been felt in terms of direct foreign ownership. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/NetSaleTreasuries.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Looking from a long-term perspective, we consider the share of foreign holdings of federal debt. Here we plot two measures of national debt, 
one with intragovernmental debt included and the other without it. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/ForeignShareofFederal.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Here we see, with both measures, the continuation of a long-term decline in the foreign share of ownership of Treasuries that began
with the GFC, itself the peak of a long-term build-up of foreign ownership that began in the 90s. The chart barely registers a slight 
reversal of this decline that began in 2022, with an increase in foreign shares on both measures. Current foreign ownership is now back
at levels last seen in the late 90s (if measured by share of Debt by Held by the Public) or or the mid-2000s (if measured by share of total
debt inclusive of intragovernmental holdings). </p>

<p> The TIC survey also contains data on foreign official v. foreign non-official holdings. Foreign official holdings refers to holdings
by foreign governments, foreign central banks (and other fiscal agents of foreign governments), and "international and regional
organizations" (such as the European Central Bank). </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/ForeignNonOfficialForeignOfficial.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> We see that foreign official holdings have remained relatively stable in absolute terms over the last three years. Foreign non-official
holdings have meanwhile grown and surpassed foreign official holdings, growing from a little under $4 trillion to a little over $5 trillion.
Over the same period, the average of monthly foreign non-official net sales has been ten times that of foreign official net sales ($52 billion
compared to $5 billion). </p>

<p> But we note that non-official investors may be more sensitive holders of Treasuries than official holders. The standard
deviation of net sales is doubled with non-official holders. In April 2025, total foreign net sales of Treasuries was -$70 billion. The
sell-off was largely driven by non-official holders, net sales of which constituted 83-84% of total foreign net sales that month. Nor can this
fact be attributed to hedge fund unwinding of the basis trade, because the Cayman islands were actually net buyers of Treasuries in April
2025. Foreign official holders, particularly central banks, tend to hold Treasuries for reasons that can be relatively insensitive to movements
in the Treasury market. For example, Treasuries are held in case the central bank needs to protect the exchange rate of the domestic currency against the 
dollar. </p>

<p> The growing share of more price-sensitive, private investors in foreign holdings should be read in conjunction with the growing share
of hedge funds and declining share of primary dealers in the domestic market. The years since the GFC have seen a gradual yet fundamental shift in the 
ownership of Treasury securities. </p>


<p> I pointed out above that China was the only country among the ten largest holders to substantially reduce its holdings of Treasuries
since the start of the year (Switzerland was the only other country to see a reduction, though it was small). Its holdings of Treasuries
fell from $760 billion in January to $688 billion in October. This is the continuation of a a longer trend, a decline from $848 billion
in January 2023 looking at monthly TIC data. If we look at annual TIC SLT data, we see a decline beginning from a peak of $1.38 trillion in
June 2018. The PRC had maintained holdings $1.2-1.3 trillion in Treasuries since 2009, having accumulated this almost entirely in the 2000s.

<p> The question of where Chinese funds flowing out of Treasuries are going to is too large and too far from the focus of this post. Some of it may still be 
held by Chinese investors but through securities depositories in Belgium and Luxembourg which do not show up on TIC survey data as Chinese holdings. 
Some of it may have been reinvested into Chinese or non-American foreign assets. But some of it may have gone into other American assets: see TIC data showing 
slight increases in the last five years of Chinese holdings of American equities, agency debt, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities. For 
this post, it is interesting to point out the decline in Chinese holdings of Treasuries is entirely in long-term securities. Chinese holdings of 
bills have actually increased spectularly, a fifteen-fold increase in less than three years (from $4 billion in January 2023 to $60 billion
in October 2025).</p>

<h2> Maturity </h2>

<p> The Treasury issues securities for a range of maturities. The maturity structure of the national debt has important economic and financial
consequences. Because of their short lifetime, bills can become money substitutes when issued in sufficient supply. This is not the case with
notes and bonds, which typically carry a term premium to compensate investors for the risk associated with longer duration assets (such as
changes in interest rates before maturity). Has there been a significant shift in the Treasury's structure of issuance toward shorter duration
debt? </p>

<p> In one sense, Treasury has shifted issuance toward the shorter end of the curve. Bill auctions have become more frequent (25-30 per month)
than they had been prior to Covid (15-20 per month), but this in itself is not a great measure as Treasury has a large class of maturities today 
(7 maturities from 6 weeks to 1 year) than it did before 2020 (5 maturities from 4 weeks to 1 year). </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/billauctionfrequencyhistorical.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> We can in addition look at monthly issuance across bills, notes, and bonds. As we expect, gross monthly issuance has been elevated
since 2020. Since bills normally make up the majority of issuance (largely attributable to their short maturities requiring more frequent
roll-over than longer duration securities), increased monthly issuance results in much more bill issuance in absolute terms than it does for
notes and bonds. But we are also interested in the share of monthly issuance that bills take up. Bills seem to exhibit cyclical variation
in issuance amount from month-to-month (around 5-10%). At the low point of an issuance cycle in November 2025, bills amounted to 85.64%
of total issuance that month. Compare this to a low point of an issuance cycle in September 2021, where bills tok up 70.81% of total issuance.
Indeed, the range of issuance shares were 70-80% in 2020-2022, whereas the range since 2023 has been 80-90% of total issuance. </p>


<figure>
	<img src=images/MonthlyIssuanceGrossBreakdown.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src=images/ShareofMonthlyIssuance.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> One explanation for increased bill issuance is that it is a form of catch-up. Looking at the breakdown of the outstanding national debt, we see
that 2020 resulted in a surge in bills (reaching nearly 20%) that was normalized by 2022 (to 10%). Bill share has since increased since 2022
while the share of notes has fallen. </p>


<figure>
	<img src=images/ShareofNationalDebtOutstandingHistorical.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Results may be exaggerated by a secular decline in the share of nonmarketable debt since the start of the
GFC, when it was around 50% of total debt outstanding. Nonmarketable debt is not sold to investors. It
consists largely of intragovernmental debt, debt the federal government "owes" to itself in a way. Certain revenue 
are legally linked to certain expenditures (e.g., your Social Security payroll taxes must go toward spending on Social 
Security). The federal government accomplishes this by routing the earmarked revenue to trust funds. When a trust fund 
receives more than it spends in a year, it receives a nonmarketable Government Account Series. 

<p> We can see the declining importance of intragovernmental debt. Since the GFC its share of total debt oustanding has halved from 40% to
20%. Yet the structure of intragovernmental statement is still largely the same. Looking at recent monthly statements of the public debt from the
Treasury, we can see the the vast majority of intragovernmental debt is still held in the form of nonmarketable Government Account Series. </p>

<figure>
	<img src=images/PublicIntragovernmentalShare.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>

<p> Once we look only at marketable debt, which is almost entirely held by the
public (a metric which includes holdings by the Fed) instead of being intragovernmental, we see that the bill share is actually around pre-GFC levels. </p> 

<figure>
	<img src=images/ShareofMarketableDebtOutstanding.png alt="Chart" width="800" height="400"> 
</figure>


<p> The headline from looking at the last 20 years of data on bills share is that current increased issuance may plausibly be attributed to a normalization
following below-average bill shares. Of course, we might ask what is the "optimal" bill share. We might also keep in mind that although bill share is now at pre-GFC
levels, the total supply of bills (in gross terms and as a percent of GDP) is significantly greater as a result of historically elevate levels of the national debt. </p>

<p> Our conclusions about the bill share are corroborated by data on the weighted average maturity of outstanding marketable debt. The following chart
is taken from Treasury's final quarterly report of 2025 to the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC). </p>

<h2> Fed Balance Sheet </h2>

<p> The balance sheet of the Federal Reserve began its present expansion during the GFC as a result of a few rounds of quantitative easing (QE): large-scale open market asset purchases
that included mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. In 2017, the Fed began a program of "balance sheet normalization," letting MBS, Treasury securities, and
agency securities "run off" the balance sheet by not replacing some of the securities once they had matured. Balance sheet run-off has faced difficulties. Markets have sometimes
gotten disoriented and the Fed has had to step in to provide emergency liquidity. More significantly, the Covid-19 crisis in financial markets led to an enormous expansion
of the Fed's balance sheet. The Fed reintroduced balance-sheet run-off (also called "quantitative tightening" or QT) in 2022 in response to inflation. Once again, QT has not occurred without
hiccups in the markets. </p>

<p> Although the Fed officially ended QT this December, it has announced a round of "reserve management purchases" of bills to the amount of $40 billion. Although some in the financial 
presses have called this a return to QE, the purchase of bills is different from the purchase of notes and bonds and significantly differently from the purchase of mortgage-backed
securities. Still, it is syptomatic of a post-GFC monetary world in which it is normalized for the Fed to keep a balanace sheet around 20% of the GDP in size (as opposed to pre-crisis
levels of 5-6%). </p>

<p> The Fed's open market purchases of securities are held through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. SOMA has consistently been a present at auctions since 2016 (for
notes and bonds, 2019 for bills), but today it is a relatively small presence. For bills it represents around 2-3% of auction purchases. For notes and bonds, it represents around
6-12%. The decline can be attributed partly to balance sheet run-off and partly to increases in supply. </p>

<p> Interestingly, it is long-term securities (10+ years) which now make up the largest maturity group within SOMA holdings. Securities with
maturities of 1-10 years have decreased since QT began in 2022. This may be attributed to the fact that a typical bond, say with a 20 year
maturity, will take longer to fall into the next maturity bucket (5-10 years) than any security in the bucket (so a 2-year note will take only
a year to fall into the next maturity bucket). Further investigation of SOMA holdings could clarify this. </p>

<h2> Fed Funds and Long-term Yields </h2>

<p> A rough estimate of the Fed's ability to conduct monetary policy with its traditional tool (the Fed Funds target range) would be to compare
the Fed Funds effective rate, an overnight rate at which banks lend Federal Reserve balances to each other, with the 10 year Treasury yield. 
We note that though the Fed has engaged in several rate cuts since 2024, the 10 year yield has been relatively unaffected. In fact, 
the 10 year yield is now above the Fed Funds effective rate. </p>

<P> We see the disconnect between short-term and long-term rates in rising
term premium, a theoretical measure of the excess return investors require for holding long-term over short-term assets. One measure of
the term premium doubled from March to May. Higher term premia can be a sign of growing uncertainty among investors over future rates. 
It is easy to attribute this to concerns over inflation, global decoupling due to trade wars, and a worsening fiscal situation for the
federal government, but it is hard to say anything definitive from data on term premia alone. </p>
